  ## Description
  This application, Professional Readme Generator, allows the user to create a robust README file with ease. The application will prompt the user with questions that they can answer in detail, which will then autogenerate into a README file in full. This helps the user save time (they won't need to create one from scrach!) and have the proper questions to answer so that future developers can review the README, easily understand what the application's intent is, and how to contribute to further development.

  ## Installation
  For installation, the user will use their command line (Terminal, Bash, etc.) and make sure they are accessing the correct index.js file that's being run. The user can then type in 'node index.js' in the command line to begin the prompt.

  ## Usage 
  The application has questions that prompt the user in filling out information that is then populated into the README file for quick access and development. The link for the walk-through video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m5LpGIjY-uOfQVmaqAsBCPDy4rUpJBQ-/view). Please click the link to launch the walk-through video.
